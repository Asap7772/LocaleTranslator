# LocaleTranslator
This script translates words for Android Studio Applications. 
Please copy all String values from the strings.xml file (except for string arrays) in your android studio folder to the language.txt file.
Choose the input language and output language in the language.py file and run to download as json files.
Rename the json files to be numerical (e.g 1.json, 2.json, etc) by right clicking the set of files and renaming them (on mac)
Run the JSONParser.py script by specifying the folder where the json is stored along with the original language.txt file to get a finalized output.
